# Mobile UI tests

## Run common UI tests on mobile screen

Note: right now we should not check all the functions, but just simple things, which can satisfy a
user, when it is the first time when user discovers JSight Editor and this first time is in his
smartphone. These tests could be:

1. Scrolling code content and document content.
2. Moving the central vertical line.
3. Tapping on the icons and menu items in the header.

## Specific mobile tests

1. Check rotating of the screen.
