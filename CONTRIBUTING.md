## Feedback

Our project is still in its early stages, so feedback is the most crucial contribution to its
development.

**Your feedback is extremely valuable to us!**

- Are you comfortable using JSight Online Editor?
- Is the [JSight API](https://jsight.io/docs/jsight-api-0-3) language user-friendly?
- What's not clear?
- Anything bothering you?
- What can be done better?
- What is missing?

Please get in touch with us and let us know what you think:

- Email: [support@jsight.io](mailto:support@jsight.io).
- Telegram: [@jsight_support](https://t.me/jsight_support).
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/jsightapi/online-editor-frontend/issues/new).

## Opening Issues

Please [raise a new issue](https://github.com/jsightapi/online-editor-frontend/issues/new) if you
discover a bug.

If you notice ways in which you can clearly enhance the JSight API Language or UI, this also makes a
great reason to raise an issue.

If you simply don't comprehend something, you can create an issue for this also. So, write: *“How do
I do X?”*. Issues like this are important to us because they help us figure out where the bottleneck
is when learning JSight.

## Commenting

Your comments on issues and pull requests are also a great help. Please share your thoughts and
suggestions, they are important to us.
 
Kindly re-read your remarks to ensure that they are as courteous as possible.

## English Language

We are not native English speakers, but we work hard to ensure that the English in our project is
perfect. If you are a native English speaker and notice any inaccuracy (in the user interface,
documentation, etc.) please write to us or submit a bug.

## Code Contributions

The `dev` branch is used for code development. Make all pull requests there.

Please do not submit a pull request unless you have a valid issue. If the required issue does not
exist, create one. It will be much easier for us to accept your code there.

If you plan to add a new feature, please open a new issue first and wait for us to approve the
change. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that your code will be accepted.

If you want to help with the project but don't know what to do, write to us and we'll find some
interesting task for you:

- Email: [support@jsight.io](mailto:support@jsight.io).
- Telegram: [@jsight_support](https://t.me/jsight_support).

### Making pull requests

- Write a precise description of what you did **in the body of the pull request**.
- Don't forget to include links to the issues it resolves in the pull request.
- If possible, squash small interim commits that will prevent us from understanding your
  corrections. Leave only useful commits that will help to understand your logic. If the revision is
  small, then squash all the commits into a single one.

### Code Style Guide

Before writing code, please read [CodeStyleGuide.md](./docs/CodeStyleGuide.md).
